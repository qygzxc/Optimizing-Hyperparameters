# Optimizing-Hyperparameters
Implementation of grid and random search methods to optimize hyperparameters. I also used a genetic algorithm, but the code is incomplete (finished but needing edits)

Here, we use multiple search methods, namely Grid Search, Random Search, and Genetic Algorithm to find the best set of hyperparamters for our model. We train on the MNIST dataset, and we implement PCA on the images before beginning the search. The PCA is meant to decrease computing power and time.
